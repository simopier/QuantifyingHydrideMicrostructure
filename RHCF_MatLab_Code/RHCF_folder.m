% Description:
% This function is called by RHCF_main and calls RHCF_file for each 
% microstructure to measure its RHCF.
% Once the analysis is over, it saves in the result folder a .csv file 
% containing the name and RHCF values of all microstructures.

% Inputs:
% - codeFolderName: The name of the folder in which the RHF code is stored.
% - imageFolderName: The name of the folder in which images are stored.
% - resultsFolderName: The name of the folder in which the results will be stored. The folder is created if it does not already exist.
% - resolution: The image resolution in dpi. Enter 0 if you want to use the resolution in the metadata of the images.

% Outputs:
% None, but it saves in the result folder a .csv file containing the name 
% and RHCF values of all microstructures.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% List all the images %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Takes the names of the images in the folder named imageFolderName and 
% create a list of their names stored in string and in double.
% Warning: images names need to contain numbers only
