% Description:
% This function is called by RHCF_folder and measure the RHCF of the
% microstructure given as input. It opens the given microstructure and
% performs the analysis.

% Inputs:
% - codeFolderName: The name of the folder in which the RHF code is stored.
% - imageFolderName: The name of the folder in which images are stored.
% - filename: Name of the microstructure file.
% - resultsFolderName: The name of the folder in which the results will be stored. The folder is created if it does not already exist.
% - resolution: The image resolution in dpi. Enter 0 if you want to use the resolution in the metadata of the images.
% - band_width: Width of the band used at the center of the image to derive the RHCP. To normalize the size of the band, it is miltiplied by the image resolution.

% Outputs:
% This function returns the RHCF value for the input microstructure.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Find and open the images %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
cd ../
cd(resultsFolderName)
binaryImage = imcomplement(imread([filename '_binary' '.tiff']));
cd ../
cd(codeFolderName)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Determine the image resolution %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    cd ../
    cd(imageFolderName)
    info = imfinfo(filename);
    resolution=info.XResolution;
    cd ../
    cd(codeFolderName)
end

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Selects the center band of the image %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Only select the center band if the desired band width is smaller than
% image size
if band_width*resolution < size(binaryImage,2)
    % select the center band
    band_start = round(size(binaryImage,2)/2-band_width*resolution/2);
    band_end = round(size(binaryImage,2)/2+band_width*resolution/2);
    % Warning message if band_width is too small for the image to possess
    % more than 10 pixels
    if band_end-band_start < 10
        disp('Warning: The band_width is probably too small')
        pause(10)
    end
    binaryImage = binaryImage(:,band_start:band_end);
end

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Analysis %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Get the length of the projected hydrides
hydride_segments_lengths = HydrideSegments(binaryImage);

% Get longest continuous radial segment of hydrides
Max_Segment = max(hydride_segments_lengths);

% Derive RHCF
RHCF = Max_Segment/size(binaryImage,1);
