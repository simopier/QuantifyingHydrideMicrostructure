% Description:
% This function is called by imageBinary_folder.m and calls thershold.m,
% the GUI function, to let the user select the appropriate binarization
% parameters. imageBinary.m then binarizes the image using these parameters
% and save the parameters and the binary image.
% If the binary parameters were already determined and saved in the result
% folder, then it will use these to binarize the figures again.


% Inputs:
% - codeFolderName: The name of the folder in which the RHF code is stored.
% - imageFolderName: The name of the folder in which images are stored.
% - filename: Name of the microstructure file.
% - startingLowThreshold: The initial value for low threshold value â‰¥0 for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
% - startingHighThreshold: The initial value for high threshold value >(startingLowThreshold) for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 255.
% - SpotSize: The binarization parameter to remove particles smaller than SpotSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
% - HoleSize: The binarization parameter to fill out holes smaller than HoleSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
% - resultsFolderName: The name of the folder in which the results will be stored. The folder is created if it does already exist.

% Outputs:
% imageBinary.m returns the binary image as well as the binarization
% parameters selected by the user. It also saves them in the result folder.
