% Description:
% This function is called by HCC_main.m and call imageBinary.m to binarize
% the microstructures in ImageFolderName. Binarizing the image is the first
% and one of the most important steps of the algorithm. The aim is to keep 
% only the hydrides in the image. The GUI helps the user define the 
% binarization parameters.
% If the binary parameters were already determined and saved in the result 
% folder, then it will use these to binarize the figures again.


% Inputs:
% - codeFolderName: The name of the folder in which the RHF code is stored.
% - imageFolderName: The name of the folder in which images are stored.
% - startingLowThreshold: The initial value for low threshold value â‰¥0 for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
% - startingHighThreshold: The initial value for high threshold value >(startingLowThreshold) for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 255.
% - SpotSize: The binarization parameter to remove particles smaller than SpotSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
% - HoleSize: The binarization parameter to fill out holes smaller than HoleSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
% - resultsFolderName: The name of the folder in which the results will be stored. The folder is created if it does already exist.

% Outputs:
% None, but this function will end up saving the binary parameters in the
% result folder, as well as the binarized images.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% List all the images %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Takes the names of the images in the folder named ImageFolderName and 
% create a list of their names stored in string and in double.
% Warning: images names need to contain numbers only

    text = names_vect(i);
    text = extractBefore(text,'.tif');

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Convert RGB images to greyscale images %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    % convert image from RGB to grayscale if needed
    if ndims(I) > 2
        I = rgb2gray(I);
    end
    % save image in folder of formated images
