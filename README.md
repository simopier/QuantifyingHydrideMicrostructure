To launch the code, you need to call the function __RHCF_main__ with the appropriate inputs:
```
RHCF_main(codeFolderName,imageFolderName,startingLowThreshold,startingHighThreshold,SpotSize,HoleSize,resolution,resultsFolderName)
```
with:
- codeFolderName: The name of the folder in which the RHCF code is stored.
- imageFolderName: The name of the folder in which images are stored.
- startingLowThreshold: The initial value for low threshold value â‰¥0 for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
- startingHighThreshold: The initial value for high threshold value >(startingLowThreshold) for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 255.
- SpotSize: The binarization parameter to remove particles smaller than SpotSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
- HoleSize: The binarization parameter to fill out holes smaller than HoleSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
- resolution: The image resolution  in dpi. Enter 0 if you want to use the resolution in the metadata of the images.
- resultsFolderName: The name of the folder in which the results will be stored. The folder is created if it does already exist.

An example of a call is:

```
RHCF_main('RHCF_Matlab_code','RHCP_Verification_Microstructures',100,255,60,10,0,'RHCF_Validation_Results')
```
#### 4. Binarize the microstructures
*The MATLAB code will open a GUI prompting you to modify the parameters to binarize the image.* 

To use the GUI, you can refer to section *12 .Instructions on how to use the GUI to binarize images.* of this document. You will be asked to define the binarization parameters for each micrograph in the image folder.  

#### 5. Monitor the algorithm
Once you are done binarizing the micrographs, the MATLAB code will start the analysis. At this point, you do not need to do anything since the analysis is automated.

#### 6. Analyze results
To analyze the results, go to the result folder, which name you defined in resultsFolderName at step *3. Launch the RHCF code.*.

You should find:
* a .csv file with the name of the result folder, which contains the list of the names of the micrographs with their corresponding RHCF.
* for each micrograph:
  * a .csv file containing the binary parameters, ending with *_BinaryParam.csv*.
  * a .tif and a .jpeg images showing the binarized micrograph, ending with *_binary.jpeg*.
  
  
## 12. Instructions on how to use the GUI to binarize images.

* Modify the parameters until you are satisfied with the microstructure on the right. The goal is to keep only the hydrides on the image. 
  * If the background light is non-uniform, you can compensate for it. Select the desired option and then enter the desired value. If needed, 10 would be a good place to start. However, you shouldn't need it for the validation images. 
  * Use the threshold values to binarize the image. The max value typically stays at the maximum value on the scale. The minimum value depends on the image. You can use the histogram below on the GUI to see where pixel intensity stands.
  * Use the spot size control to remove the dust and other features from the micrographs.
  * Use the hole size control to remove white pixels within hydrides.
* Click OK on the bottom right when you are done with one image (see example of image binarization below).
* Repeat until you hve binarized all images.
* Record the active time. (Please enter the time in minutes in __RHCP_template_time.xlsx__.)
* *The MATLAB code will then perform the measurements on its own. However, the RHCP calculations can take a long time (several hours for all images). If you want, you can stop the algorithm and I can perform the MATLAB calculations from your binarized images. If you decide to perform the analysis (Thank you!), you might want to make sure your computer will not go in screen saving mode by changing your settings. On Mac, you can also type the 'caffeinate' command in the terminal*
* __When you are done binarizing all images, please do not forget to stop the time and save the time it took you to binarize the images__.
