Open the file called __RHCF_main.m__ and make sure that MATLAB is open in the code folder.

#### 3. Launch the RHCF code 

To launch the code, you need to call the function __RHCF_main__ with the appropriate inputs:
```
RHCF_main(codeFolderName,imageFolderName,startingLowThreshold,startingHighThreshold,SpotSize,HoleSize,resolution,resultsFolderName, band_width)
```
with:
- codeFolderName: The name of the folder in which the RHCF code is stored.
- imageFolderName: The name of the folder in which images are stored.
- startingLowThreshold: The initial value for low threshold value â‰¥0 for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
- startingHighThreshold: The initial value for high threshold value >(startingLowThreshold) for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 255.
- SpotSize: The binarization parameter to remove particles smaller than SpotSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
- HoleSize: The binarization parameter to fill out holes smaller than HoleSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
- resolution: The image resolution  in dpi. Enter 0 if you want to use the resolution in the metadata of the images.
- resultsFolderName: The name of the folder in which the results will be stored. The folder is created if it does already exist.
- band_width: is the width of the band used to derive RHCF. The unit depends on the unit of the variable 'resolution'. d = 0.150 mm. Use Inf to use the entire image.

An example of a call is:

```
RHCF_main('RHCF_Matlab_code','RHCP_Verification_Microstructures',100,255,60,10,0,'RHCF_Validation_Results',150)
```
#### 4. Binarize the microstructures
*The MATLAB code will open a GUI prompting you to modify the parameters to binarize the image.* 

To use the GUI, you can refer to section *12 .Instructions on how to use the GUI to binarize images.* of this document. You will be asked to define the binarization parameters for each micrograph in the image folder.  

#### 5. Monitor the algorithm
Once you are done binarizing the micrographs, the MATLAB code will start the analysis. At this point, you do not need to do anything since the analysis is automated.

#### 6. Analyze results
To analyze the results, go to the result folder, which name you defined in resultsFolderName at step *3. Launch the RHCF code.*.

You should find:
* a .csv file with the name of the result folder, which contains the list of the names of the micrographs with their corresponding RHCF.
* for each micrograph:
  * a .csv file containing the binary parameters, ending with *_BinaryParam.csv*.
  * a .tif and a .jpeg images showing the binarized micrograph, ending with *_binary.jpeg*.
  
  
## 12. Instructions on how to use the GUI to binarize images.

When using one of these MATLAB algorithm, you will be prompt to use a GUI to binarize the microstructures being analyzed. Please note that if the microstructure have already been binarized and that the binarization parameters are saved in the results folder, then the MATLAB code will use these parameters instead of asking you to binarize them again. If you want to binarize them again, input a different result folder name. The GUI will appear as shown in the following image:

* 1 shows the initial microstructure being analyzed.
* 2 shows the binarized microstructure. Parts of the microstructure are kept (shown in black), and the rest of the microstructure is filtered out (shown in white). Inthis image, holes and small particules of the desired size have been filled and removed, respectively (See '4' to see how to change the desired sizes of holes and particles).
* 3 shows the final binarized microstructure, i.e. the one that will be analyzed by the algorithm. The hydrides have been skeletonized. 
* 4 allows you to determine the parameters for the binarization process. Each change made on 4 affects images 2 and 3.
	* Min Threshold corresponds to the value of the lower threshold. Decreasing it removes the lighter pixels. 
	* Max threshold corresponds to the value of the higher threshold. Decreasing it includes lighter pixels. It it usually set to the maximum value
	* Size spot removal corresponds to the size in pixels of the particles that you wish to filter out. Increasing this value will filter out larger particules. 
	* Size holes removal corresponds to the size in pixels of the holes that you wish to fill out. Holes are groups of white pixels completely surrounded by black pixels. Increasing this value will fill out larger holes.
	* You can filter out, or not, the groups of pixels that are in contact with the border of the image. 
* 5 allows you to compensate, or not, for a non-uniform background lighting. The value for the non-uniform ighting compensation can be changed from 0 to a large number if necessary. It's effect can change depending on the image, do not be afraid to play with it and find a value that provides the best results. I recommend that you first try to obtain the best binary picture possible using commands described in 4 before trying to compensate for non-uniform background lighting. 4 and 5 will then probably have to be used together to find the optimum values.
* 6 shows the histogram of the grayscale pixels. It can be used to set up the Min and Max values for the threaholds in 4.
* 7 shows the number of hydrides counted by the algorithm.
* 8 is the OK button, that you can press once you are satisfied with the parameters you chose and the microstructure on the right, in 3. Once pressed, the algorithm will save these parameters and move on the the next image, or to the analysis if you went through every images.

The following figure shows an example of a microstructure and it's binarized version.
