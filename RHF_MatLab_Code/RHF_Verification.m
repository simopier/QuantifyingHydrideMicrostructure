% Description:
% This function is used for the verification of the RHF definition and
% implementation. It is called by RHF_Verification_Script.m to perform the
% analysis. It calls RHF_main to measure the RHF of verification
% microstructures.

% Inputs:
% - codeFolderName: The name of the folder in which the RHF code is stored.
% - imageFolderName: The name of the folder in which images are stored.
% - imageFolderNameExpectedRHF: Name of the folder containing the expected values for RHF.
% - csvfilename_Expected: Name of the .csv file in imageFolderNameExpectedRHF containing the list of the microstructures names and expected RHF values.
% - startingLowThreshold: The initial value for low threshold value â‰¥0 for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
% - startingHighThreshold: The initial value for high threshold value >(startingLowThreshold) for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 255.
% - SpotSize: The binarization parameter to remove particles smaller than SpotSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
% - HoleSize: The binarization parameter to fill out holes smaller than HoleSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
% - resolution: The image resolution in dpi. Enter 0 if you want to use the resolution in the metadata of the images.
% - lengthCut: The length used to cut the hydrides to approximate them a straight lines. Use InF to select the whole hydrides.
% - resultsFolderName: The name of the folder in which the results will be stored. The folder is created if it does already exist.

% Outputs:
% This function returns a vector with the error in RHF measurements, and 
% saves a file containing the error of the RHF predictions.
