# Tutorial to use MATLAB and make measurements of Radial Hydride Fraction on real micrographs for validation. 

To validate the new definition and implementation of the RHF, the results are compared with human measurements made using ImageJ. 
This tutorial explains how to perform the measurements on MATLAB. 
Luckily, MATLAB does most of the work and the user is needed only to select the right parameters to binarize the images

## 0 - Download MATLAB
* As a PennState student, you can download MATLAB [here](https://softwarestore.psu.edu/mathworks-license/-8474).
* As a student, you can download MATLAB [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html).
* You can download MATLAB [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html?s_tid=gn_getml).

## 2 - Download the MATLAB code
You can download the MATLAB code for the Radial Hydride Fraction [here]()0000000000000000.

## 3 - Download folder containing the validation images. 
* You can download the folder containing the Validation images for RHF validation [here](https://github.com/simopier/QuantifyingHydrideMicrostructure/tree/master/RHF_Validation_Microstructures).
* Save the folder in the same folder where you saved the RHF MATLAB code folder (*do not save the image folder in the code folder itself, you should have two separate folders next to each other.*). 

## 4 - Open MATLAB
* Open the file called __RHFIntersection_main.m__ and make sure that MATLAB is in the code folder.

## 5 - Launch the RHF code 
To launch the code, you need to call the function __RHFIntersection_main__ with the appropriate inputs:
```
RHFIntersection_main(codeFolderName,imageFolderName,startingLowThreshold,startingHighThreshold,SpotSize,HoleSize,resolution, lengthCut,resultsFolderName)
```
with:
- codeFolderName: The name of the folder in which the RHF code is stored.
- imageFolderName: The name of the folder in which images are stored.
- startingLowThreshold: The initial value for low threshold value â‰¥0 for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
- startingHighThreshold: The initial value for high threshold value >(startingLowThreshold) for the binarization process. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 255.
- SpotSize: The binarization parameter to remove particles smaller than SpotSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
- HoleSize: The binarization parameter to fill out holes smaller than HoleSize in pixels. To be adjusted in GUI. We recommend starting with 0.
- resolution: The image resolution  in dpi. Enter 0 if you want to use the resolution in the metadata of the images.
- lengthCut: The length used to cut the hydrides to approximate them a straight lines. Use InF to select the whole hydrides.
- resultsFolderName: The name of the folder in which the results will be stored. The folder is created if it does already exist.

An example of a call is:

```
RHFIntersection_main('RHF_MatLab_Code','RHF_Validation_Microstructures',240,255,90,10,0,InF,'RHF_Validation_Results')
```

* *The MATLAB code will open a GUI promptung you to modify the parameters to binarize the image.* 
* Click OK on the bottom right when you are done with one image.
* Repeat until you hve binarized all images.
* *The MATLAB code will then perform the measurements on its own.*
